### Slide 81
**Title:** Welcome Back to Programming 1  
**Content:**  
Hello, everyone! Welcome back to Programming 1. In this section of our first lesson, we’re going to take a big step forward and write our very first Python program. We’re going to start simple, but it’s a crucial step in your learning journey.

### Slide 82
**Title:** Introducing "Hello, World!"  
**Content:**  
In the programming world, “Hello, World!” is usually the very first program you write when learning a new programming language. It’s a simple program that does one thing: it prints the text “Hello, World!” to the screen. This small exercise will introduce you to:
- The syntax of Python: How to write instructions in Python.
- How to run a Python program: How to execute Python code and see results.
- How to use output in Python: This means printing something to the screen.

### Slide 83
**Title:** Writing the Program  
**Content:**  
Let’s start by opening the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), which we covered earlier. This is the interactive environment where we can type Python code and see the results immediately. When you have the REPL open, it will show you a prompt that looks like this:
```
>>>
```
This is where you type your Python code. To print “Hello, World!” to the screen, you’ll use the print() function, which is a built-in function in Python that displays information on the screen.

### Slide 84
**Title:** Typing the Code  
**Content:**  
Here’s what you need to type:
```
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
```
Let’s break it down:
- `print()` is the function we’re calling. A function is like a set of instructions that Python can execute.
- The "Hello, World!" part is a string. In Python, strings are text, and they must be enclosed in quotes (either double quotes "" or single quotes '').
- When you press Enter, Python runs the print() function and shows the text on the screen.

### Slide 85
**Title:** Understanding the Code  
**Content:**  
Now, let’s take a deeper look at what happened:
1. The print() function: This function tells Python to display something. In this case, we asked it to display the text "Hello, World!".
2. The String: "Hello, World!" is a string. A string is just a sequence of characters, and it can be any text you want.
3. The Parentheses: The parentheses () are used to enclose the arguments or values that the function needs. In our case, the string "Hello, World!" is the argument for the print() function.
4. The Quotation Marks: The quotation marks are used to define a string in Python. You could also use single quotes like this:
```
>>> print('Hello, World!')
Hello, World!
```

### Slide 86
**Title:** Running the Program in a File  
**Content:**  
While the REPL is great for testing out small bits of code, most of the time we’ll be writing Python programs in a file. So, let’s talk about how to write your first program in a file, run it, and see the results.
1. Create a Python file: Open the nano editor (or your preferred text editor), and create a new file called hello_world.py. In this file, type the following:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
2. Save the file: In nano, press Ctrl + O to save the file, then Ctrl + X to exit the editor.
3. Run the Python file: Now, go back to your terminal (or command line) and type:
```
python3 hello_world.py
```

### Slide 87
**Title:** What Just Happened?  
**Content:**  
When you ran the command `python3 hello_world.py`, Python looked at the file, executed the code inside, and printed the result to the screen. It’s as simple as that! This is the basic flow of working with Python files:
- You write your code in a text file (with a .py extension).
- You run the code using the Python interpreter (by typing `python3 filename.py` in the terminal).
- Python executes the code and prints the output.

**Title:** Experimenting with Variations  
**Content:**  
Now that you’ve written and run your first program, you can experiment with some variations. For example, you could change the message:
```
print("Welcome to Programming 1!")
```
Or, you could try printing numbers or doing some math:
```
print(5 + 3)
print("The answer is:", 5 + 3)
```

### Slide 91
**Title:** Welcome Back to Programming 1  
**Content:**  
- Hello, everyone! Welcome back to Programming 1.  
- In this section, we’re going to dive into Python’s interpreter and script mode.  
- These are key concepts for writing and running Python programs.  
- You’ll learn how Python code is executed and what the different ways are to run your programs effectively.

### Slide 92
**Title:** Recap: Python REPL  
**Content:**  
- We’ve been using the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to test small pieces of code.  
- This is great for quick experiments.  
- But as your programs get more complex, you’ll want a way to write and organize your code more effectively.  
- This is where script mode comes in.

### Slide 93
**Title:** What is Python’s Interpreter?  
**Content:**  
- The Python interpreter is a program that reads your Python code, processes it, and executes it.  
- When you type code into the REPL, the interpreter reads each line, immediately executes it, and then shows the result.  
- Think of the Python interpreter as the translator for your Python code.  
- It converts human-readable Python instructions into something the computer can understand and act on.

### Slide 94
**Title:** How the Interpreter Works  
**Content:**  
1. You type Python code.  
2. The interpreter reads that code, one line at a time.  
3. The interpreter executes the code immediately and shows you the results.  
- This is how the Python interpreter works in the REPL.

### Slide 95
**Title:** Using Python in Script Mode  
**Content:**  
- While the REPL is great for trying small pieces of code, when you want to write a more complex program, you’ll use script mode.  
- In script mode, you write your Python code in a file (with a .py extension), then run that file with the interpreter.  
- This is how you typically write and run Python programs:
  1. Write your Python code in a text file (for example, my_program.py).  
  2. Run the file by calling the Python interpreter and passing the filename as an argument (e.g., python3 my_program.py).

### Slide 96
**Title:** How to Use Script Mode  
**Content:**  
1. Create a Python file:
   - Open nano, which is a simple text editor in the terminal.  
   - Type the following code into a new file:

     ```python
     # my_program.py
     print("Hello, from script mode!")
     ```

   - Save the file by pressing Ctrl + O and then exit the editor by pressing Ctrl + X.  
2. Run the Python file:
   - Back in the terminal, type the following command to run the script:

     ```bash
     python3 my_program.py
     ```

   - After running this command, you’ll see "Hello, from script mode!" printed to the terminal.

### Slide 97
**Title:** Basic Flow of Script Mode  
**Content:**  
- You write your code in a .py file.  
- You run the file using the Python interpreter.  
- The interpreter reads the entire file, executes the code, and shows you the results.  
- This is the basic flow of working with Python files in script mode.

### Slide 98
**Title:** Why Use Script Mode?  
**Content:**  
1. Organizing Code: When you start writing larger programs, it’s better to organize your code into multiple lines and sections.  
2. Reusability: Once your code is written in a file, you can run it again anytime without retyping it. You can also share it with others, making your code reusable.  
3. Debugging: When writing in script mode, you can edit your code, add comments, and structure your program logically. It’s easier to debug and improve your program as it grows.

### Slide 99
**Title:** Differences Between the REPL and Script Mode  
**Content:**  
- REPL:
  - Ideal for quick testing.  
  - Executes code line-by-line.  
  - Limited to short scripts and simple tests.  
- Script Mode:
  - Ideal for writing complete programs.  
  - You write code in a .py file and run it all at once.  
  - Code can be organized into functions, classes, and modules.
