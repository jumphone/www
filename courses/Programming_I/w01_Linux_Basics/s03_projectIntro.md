## Let’s make a movie ！！！

<br>

-----------

### Basic Goal

* Keywords: Python, LLM, API, Prompt, Movie

* Learn to use Python with the APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate coherent prompts (movie scripts) for movie clips.

* Create a <b> Python Movie-Scriptwriter program </b> which can automatically generate coherent prompts (movie scripts) for movie clips.

* Generate a 1-minute coherent mini-movie consisting of six 10-second movie clips.

<br>

-----------

### Hint

* There is an AI assistant on our server. The AI assistant is based on the API of Kimi.

* The location of AI assistant on our linux server: "/home/toolkit/tools/ai/ai.py". Use it, understand the code

* You can use Dou Bao (豆包) or Ji Meng (即梦) to generate the 10-second movie clips from your movie scripts.

<br>

-----------

### Requirements

* Your code must be modified based on the "/home/toolkit/tools/ai/ai.py".

* Prompts for the movie’s six clips must be generated iteratively: each clip’s prompt is based on the previous one, implemented with Python loop syntax.

* You should pack useful code block into functions.

* User input is limited to a simple description under 20 English words.

### Final Presentation

30 minutes presentation + 5 minutes QA

* 1-minute mini-movie

* Live demo: Generate 6 coherent movie-scripts from input within 20 words.

* Slides: Explain the code implementation details of the Movie-Scriptwriter program in detail, with a focus on how to use functions and loop syntax.
