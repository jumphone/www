### Weekly Plan

#### Non-Recitation Weeks:

1. Lecture + Seminar + Examples: 90 mins
2. Hands‑on Practice + Q&A + Submit Weekly Report: 90 mins

#### Recitation Weeks:

1. Review: 45~90 mins
2. Test: 45~90 mins
3. Team Work + Q&A: the remaining time

<br>

---------------------------

### Team Arrangement

1. In total, we have 5 teams (5-7 members per team).

2. We have multiple rounds of member selection.

3. In each round, each Team Lead will provide one offer to one member (you can reject the offer, and then the lead should turn to another one). 

4. For the final project, the maximum grade is 30 (final presentation). Team Lead can get 3 bonus points (10%).

5. If more than 5 people want to be the team lead, let’s vote for it. If less than 5 people want to be the lead, I will randomly assign the remaining team lead.

### Final Grade

* We use a quantile-based evaluation method to calculate the final grade (ranging from 0 to 100), which consists of three components:

1. General Performance (weekly reports in non-recitation weeks)
2. Final Project (final presentation + slides)
3. Total Test Score (recitation sessions)

* For each component, a student’s quantile within the entire cohort is calculated. Quantiles are calculated as percentiles (0 = lowest, 1.0 = highest) within the entire cohort. The Average Quantile (AQ) is then computed across all three components. If a student’s AQ is below 0.2, they will receive a “FAIL” grade. In addition, if the AQ is lower than 0.2 but the Actual Score (AS) on the Total Test Score exceeds passing line, the final grade will be marked as 60 (passed with a low final grade).

```
if AQ ≥ 0.2:
    Passed, Final Grade = (AQ – 0.2) / (AQmax – 0.2) × 40 + 60
else if AQ < 0.2 and Total Test Score ≥ Passing Line:
    Passed, Final Grade = 60
else if AQ < 0.2 and Total Test Score < Passing Line:
    Failed, Final Grade = AQ / 0.2 × 60

# Note: "AQmax" refers to the actual highest AQ value among all students in the cohort.
```
