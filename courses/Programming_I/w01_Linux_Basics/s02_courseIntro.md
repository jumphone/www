###  Team Arrangement

1. In total, we have 10 teams.

2. We have multiple rounds of member selection.

3. In each round, each Team Lead will provide one offer to one member (you can reject the offer, and then the lead should turn to another one). 

4. For each team work, the grade is ranging from 1 to 5. Team Lead can get 1 bonus point.

5. If more than 10 people want to be the team lead, let’s vote for it. If less than 10 people want to be the lead, I will randomly assign the remaining team lead.
