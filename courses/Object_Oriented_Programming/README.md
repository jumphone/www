### Suggestion: Make full use of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Kimi).

Final Goal:

There is an AI assistant on our server.
The AI assistant is based on the API (Application Programming Interface) of Kimi.
The location of AI assistant on our server: /home/toolkit/tools/ai/ai.py
Use it, understand the code, and propose a way to improve it.
