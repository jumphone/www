    - Before building models, we visualize data to spot missing values, detect patterns, and identify outliers.  
    - Example: Using a scatter plot to see the relationship between two variables.  
  🔹 Model Performance Evaluation  
    - In machine learning, we use confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and feature importance plots to evaluate models.  
  🔹 Presentation of Results  
    - Whether you are working in business, healthcare, or research, your results must be communicated visually to be understood by non-technical audiences.

### Slide 113: Best Practices for Creating Effective Visualizations
**Content:**  
- A good visualization should be:  
  ✅ Clear and simple – Avoid unnecessary elements that make the chart harder to read.  
  ✅ Well-labeled – Axes, titles, and legends should be easy to understand.  
  ✅ Accurate – The data should be represented correctly (e.g., avoiding misleading scales).  
  ✅ Color-coded effectively – Use colors to highlight key differences but avoid overcomplicating the chart.  
- Here are some common mistakes to avoid:  
  ❌ Using too many colors or 3D effects that make the chart look cluttered.  
  ❌ Making axes misleading (e.g., not starting at
